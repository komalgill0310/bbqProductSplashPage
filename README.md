- It was exciting to apply my knowledge of responsive design to make my project look good and work well on different devices. It was a valuable learning experience to understand how to use media queries and flexible units like percentages and viewport units to create a responsive layout. Overall, building a responsive design project was a fun and educational exercise that helped me improve my web development skills.
